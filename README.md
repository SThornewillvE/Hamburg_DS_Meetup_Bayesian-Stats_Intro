Author: Simon Thornewill von Essen

Start Date: 2019-05-29

## Description

On 2019-08-22, I will be giving a talk at the [Hamburg Data Science Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Hamburg-Data-Science-Meetup/events/259329049/)
introducing the topic of Bayesian Statistics.

My goals of this talk are as follows:

1. Outline an Intution for the Topic
2. Show some sources for those who want to learn more
3. Show basic applications
4. Use a demo to show this framework in action

I would like there to be a mix of mathematical, programmatic and intuitive approaches so that an audience member that is interested in this topic can 
begin to do some basic implementations of what I lay out and continue exploring on their own.

## Repo layout

This repo is laid out into a couple of sub directories:

* `./python` - Code for the presentation
* `./slides` - Slides used for the presentation
* `./sources` - Contains handwritten notes for various presentations/courses. All solidified into a README.

The number of directories might change and the README will be updated as necessary.

## Packages Used

* To be filled later

## Awknowledgements and Citations

* To be filled later
* Also, make sure to check the sources directory.
