# Bayesian Stats Sources

In this subdirectory of the repository I would like to outline the major sources that I have used to 
inform my understanding of bayesian statistics and should be used as a starting point.

I will also outline the strengths and weaknesses of each source so that people can more easily choose
which sources are most relevant for them.
